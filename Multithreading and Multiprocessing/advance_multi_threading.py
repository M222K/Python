### Multithreading With Thread Pool Executor-this is advanced way to apply multithreading where we can assign multiple threads to complete a process fastly

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def print_number(number):
    time.sleep(1)
    return f"Number :{number}"

numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3]

#workers==no of threads assigned 
#executer.map (sets the exceution for desired process as target)
t=time.time()
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    results=executor.map(print_number,numbers)

for result in results:
    print(result)
    
finished_time=time.time()-t
print(finished_time)
